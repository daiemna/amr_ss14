Your solution does not handle concave corners well: the state seems to get stuck, but you mention 
that yourself in the last commit message. Your 'charge' behaviour seems to be smoothed out near the end: 
well done! 

The logic for switching between right and left wallfollowing seems to be in place. Also, the configurable 
clearance is there. The state logic and configurability lead to situations your robot cannot handle, e.g. 
when clearance levels are changed in the 'charge' state. 

Your solution is clearly not ready, but you are well on your way.
