Your time report is missing. From now on this will lead to negative points, as this is vital information to the teachers.

Your commit history is not satisfactory: you need to build your code in smaller iterations. Why don't you first write down in pseudocode what you want your node to do. 

Please proper indentations for your code!

Do not use magic numbers (e.g. '4' in line 50 of the omni .cpp)!

You are working in the global reference frame, but we need the velocities to be in the robot frame. This probably is enough to explain your behaviour, but we can discuss this in lab class.

The required velocity profile is missing in your behaviour.

You received points for your implementation because you did setup most of the logic needed for it to be proper.
