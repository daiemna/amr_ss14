Feedback
========

In your differential drive implementation, you could increase code readability by adding parentheses in the formulae.

Behaviour description is missing.

Your git workflow needs to be improved. I would have expected to see smaller commits with better descriptions. You did not really split up your commits into smaller functionality bits and parts. Your commit messages are not descriptive of the actual changes you implemented. Please make sure you change this in the future.

Other than that: great job!
